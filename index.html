                        <h2>The Journal Begins</h2>
                        <h3>This shit is arcane</h3>
                        <p>So far the hardest thing to learn is how each element fits with the surrounding/enclosing elements.  The developer tools have been critical in figuring out what formatting is coming from where.</p>
                        <p>The lecture Tuesday night about how floating elements are just a completely different universe than non-floated elements was extremely helpful.  Who would have guessed it was so funky?</p>

                            <h3>I could make this prettier but I'm not going to</h3>
                            <p>I feel like to get more out of this exercise I would start from scratch and rewrite it.  But I'd rather start with something new, so am looking forward to class tonight for our next project.</p>
                            <p>I also think I have a pretty good idea of how git works, and ditto on looking forward to getting to use it for a specific project.</p>
                            <p>The ping pong exercise was good but it would have helped to have a little context for how git usually fits into a development process.  We kept trying things and ending up with weird results, but they were things we'd never actually do.</p>
                            <p>But then that's how you want us to learn :)</p>
                            <p>The demo of Chrome developer tools was really good - I'd been using it but hadn't gone exploring into different tabs.</p>
